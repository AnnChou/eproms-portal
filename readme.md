# ePROMS Portal

This project was completed as a field project (for a health authority context) for **HINF 597: Health Terminology Standards** at the University of Victoria in 2020 by **Ann Chou**.  
It explores the integration of patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) into electronic health records using standards-based tools.

---

## âœ¨ Overview

The ePROMS Portal is a prototype web interface where patients can report their symptoms using validated PROMs.  
It supports shared decision-making and patient-centered care by embedding PROMs into EHRs via HL7 FHIR and LOINC standards.

## ðŸ’» Features

- Built with LHC-Forms FHIR SDC tools  
- Uses validated PROMs like PHQ-9 and PROMIS  
- Outputs FHIR-compliant `Questionnaire` and `QuestionnaireResponse` resources  
- Includes mappings to SNOMED CT  
- Evaluated with heuristic inspection and cognitive walkthrough

- `index.html` â€“ Optional profile/landing page  
- `eproms.html` â€“ Full case study write-up  
- `assets/` â€“ PDF report, screenshots, figures  
- `json/` â€“ FHIR and SNOMED CTâ€“compliant resources  

### ðŸ”§ JSON Folder Contents

- `phq9-questionnaire.json`: PHQ-9 as a FHIR Questionnaire  
- `phq9-questionnaire-response.json`: Example patient response

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project demonstrates how mental healthâ€“related PROMs (like PHQ-9) can be captured, modeled, and semantically mapped to enable patient participation in digital health systems.  
These examples are useful for prototyping, teaching, or extending your own ePROMS solutions.
